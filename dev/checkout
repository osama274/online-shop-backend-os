      "description": "The houseplant known as the Cast iron or bar room plant is the species Pachira Aquatica elatior from the Pachira Aquatica genus. This plant genus has over 90 species and belong to the Asparagaceae family. It originates from the forests of China and Japan. The Cast iron plant quickly established itself across all of Europe as a ubiquitous houseplant thanks to its robustness and uncomplicated care requirements, and enjoys a reputation as an indestructible houseplant. The leafy plant is often used as decoration in offices, restaurants and stores in particular (which is why it is often sometimes known as the bar room plant). Its long leaves are also used by florists as foliage ornamentation.",
